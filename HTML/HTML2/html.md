What is HTML attribute?
HTML attribute is a modifier of an HTML element type.
An attribute either modifies the default functionality of an element type or provides functionality to certain element types unable to function correctly without them.
Attributes are defined within the opening tag of an element, after the element's name.
Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value".
