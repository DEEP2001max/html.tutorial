What is HTML?
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard markup language used for creating web pages and applications. HTML uses tags to structure the content and define the layout of a web page. 
It is the backbone of the World Wide Web and is supported by all web browsers.
HTML5 is the latest version of HTML. It has added new elements that help web developers create more interactive websites.
HTML is a markup language and not a programming language. This means that it cannot be used to create dynamic functionality. Instead, it is used to create static documents that will be viewed in a web browser.
HTML is not case sensitive. This means that you can use uppercase or lowercase letters when writing HTML tags. However, it is recommended to use lowercase letters for consistency.
HTML tags are enclosed in angle brackets < >. The first tag in a pair is the start tag, and the second tag is the end tag. The end tag is written the same as the start tag, except that it has a forward slash / before the tag name.
The content between the start and end tags is the element content. Some elements have no content and are called empty elements. Empty elements do not have an end tag.
HTML documents are saved with the .html file extension. They can be created using a text editor or an HTML editor.
HTML documents must start with a document type declaration <!DOCTYPE html>. This tells the browser that the document is an HTML5 document.
